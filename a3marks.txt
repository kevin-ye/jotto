
CS349 ASSIGNMENT 3 MARKING SCHEME
MARKED BY: (jingjie.zheng@uwaterloo.ca)

GUIDELINES
The assignment needs to compile and run in order for the TA to mark it.
If it doesn't compile, but the TA is able to get it working, you will
only lose marks for the "Compiles and runs" section.
If they cannot get it to compile, you receive zero for the assignment.

Remark requests will be considered for 2 weeks following the release of
the marks for this assignment.
To request a remark, contact the TA that marked your assignment (identified
above) during office hours or through email.

MARKS
Total: 97/100

Compiles and Runs (4/5%)
[4/5] Makefile exists; README file exists with enhancements documented; 'make run' compiles and runs
// make run won't work

Working Game (29/30%)
[10/10] The game correctly computes and displays the number of partial and exact matches
      // -5 incorrect partial/exact matches
[4/5] Player guesses are validated, and players are informed of illegal guesses
// The letters should be case insensitive
[5/5] The game ends when target is guessed or when all guesses have been exhausted
[5/5] The system uses at least one JTable or JTree
[5/5] Target word can be generated automatically and manually

Program Architecture (20/30%)
[0/10] Models and views are clearly separated
      (e.g., No view-specific code in the model. Views do not duplicate model state, Etc.)
// It's very unclear: data are commonly appering in a supposedly view class.
[10/10] There are at least 3 views which all implement a (restricted) common interface
      // -5 for no common interface
      // -2 for missing one view
[5/5] Views should be registered to the model as abstract types, and maintained in a list
     // -2 for no list used to maintain views
[5/5] When a model's state changes, all registered views should be notified via each view's update method

GUI Layout & Aesthetics (14/15%)
[4/5] Pleasing layout using Gestalt principles
[5/5] Layout is maintained through a reasonable range of window sizes
[5/5] Use of nested layout managers

[X] A view showing which letters have been guessed and which have not.
[X] Allow user to annotate letters with "must be in the target" and "can't be in the target".
[] Generate at least 2 kinds of hints
   [] lists of words that contain or exclude given sets of letters.
